Welcome to my DAO playground! This is where I mess around with smart contracts, test decentralized governance concepts, and basically try not to break my code (too often). If you're here expecting the next big DAO revolution, you might want to lower those expectations.

**What’s This About?**

- **Learning by Doing**: I'm practicing Solidity by building a pretend DAO. Think of it as a sandbox for a curious dev.
- **Cool Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts that may or may not work perfectly. They compile, and that’s a win in my book.
- **Governance Experiments**: Playing with voting, token issuance, and other DAO-like features because why not?


I’m on a mission to get better at Solidity, understand how DAOs tick, and maybe even get a few "Aha!" moments along the way. This isn’t production code — it’s more like my coding diary.
